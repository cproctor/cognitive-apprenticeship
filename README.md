## Next steps

- Make the submenu context-aware

## For the future

- Use FlatPage https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/flatpages/ for
  About page. TinyMCE can be the editor. https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html
- Add a global setting for reviewer assignment policy. For example, at the end of the semester I no longer want reviewers to be assigned. I want the option to assign them myself.
