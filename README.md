TODO

- When a revision is resubmitted, don't automatically assign reviewers. Instead,
  let the editor make this decision.

- Each paper should also come with a prebuilt bibliographic entry; get students
  to start citing each others' papers.
  - Configure journal info in settings

- Use FlatPage https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/flatpages/ for
  About page. TinyMCE can be the editor. https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html

## Documentation

- Reviewers are assigned to manuscripts, as they stay with manuscripts
  throughout the review process. This may include feedback on multiple
  revisions.
